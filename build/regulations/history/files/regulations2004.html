<h2>Article 1: Officials</h2>
A competition must have independent judges, score takers and scramblers for each event of the competition. Every event must have a main judge who is responsible for following the rules and making decisions in case of doubt. Judges must follow the procedures and if the procedure is not followed correctly by the competitor, or in special cases (like puzzle defects, incomplete solves, equipment failure), the main judge decides about the outcome, based on the rules provided below.<br>
The main judge for an event must be independent and may not compete in the event. Scramblers and judges can compete in the event, but they have to compete before all other competitors, with the scrambling and judging done by someone not competing in the event.<br>
<br>
Judges may begin a round later than scheduled, but not sooner than scheduled without a clear announcement to all competitors. Judges may allow a competitor to begin a turn later than their scheduled time. Judges may award a competitor another turn or qualifying turn due to interference or distraction created by a person or persons or facility distractions such as power failure, emergency alarms, etc.<br>

<h2>Article 2: Competitors</h2>
Any person can be a competitor during a competition, if he:<br>
<ul>
<li>accepts the rules of the competition;</li>
<li>meets the qualification times which must be clearly announced before the competition.</li>
</ul>
Competitors younger than 18 must first ask their parent(s)/guardian(s) for permission.<br>
<br>
An open competition is open to anyone.<br>
A closed competition may be open to:<br>
<ul>
<li>citizens of specific geographical areas</li>
<li>members of specific clubs</li>
<li>students / employees of specific organizations.</li>
</ul>
No other distinctions are allowed to declare a competition closed.<br>
<br>
Registrants must provide all required information for their registration to be considered complete. All information can be used for the competition only, and can only be given to other organizations/persons after permission from the competitor.<br>
Competitors must show a passport/id-card during registration at the location to prove their identity.<br>
<br>
Competitors must obey venue rules and are expected to conduct themselves in a manner considerate of others at all times during the competition and while at the competition venue. Competitors must remain quiet when inside the designated competition area. Talking is permitted, but must be kept at a reasonable level, and away from those competing.<br>
<br>
Competitors may dress in jeans, pants, shorts, slacks, skirts, shoes, T-shirts or dress shirts. Hats may be worn. Clothes can not display vulgar language or have inappropriate pictures. Shirt and shoes are always required.<br>
<br>
Disqualification of a competitor may be enforced by the main judge for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>competitor fails to show up for the event in time for registration;</li>
<li>competitor fails to show up for a round of competition in a given event;</li>
<li>competitor is suspect of cheating or defrauding the judges during competition;</li>
<li>competitor is unruly, disrespectful of other's personal space or person conducting themselves in a way that is unlawful or indecent or for damage to the venue facilities or anyone's personal property within the venue;</li>
<li>competitor interferes or becomes a blatant distraction to others during the competition;</li>
<li>competitor refuses to abide by any of the rules herein during the competition.</li>
</ul>
The main judge shall govern and determine grounds for any disqualification at its sole discretion after citing grounds for disqualification to any competitor. Disqualification occurs immediately or after warning based on the nature of the infraction.<br>
Competitors are not eligible for any refund of any expenses they incurred to be part of the competition as a result of disqualification.<br>
<br>
Competitors may challenge a ruling in a round in verbal form and be subject to the presiding judge’s discretion. However, disputes or challenges are only allowed within the parameters of a judge’s discretion. No disputes or challenges are allowed regarding to the competition rules herein. Failure by the competitor to accept the final ruling will be grounds for disqualification.

<h2>Article 3: Puzzles</h2>
Competitors can use their own puzzles. The organization team of a competition must provide some extra, reasonably smooth and stable, puzzles for competitors who do not have a good puzzle. The provided puzzles are available to the competitor preferably immediately after the registration for the event until the end of the event, but at least 5 minutes before the competitor must compete.<br>
<br>
Competitors can use any normal 6 color sticker scheme for cubes, as long as the cubes show 1 color per face in solved position. The colors of the cube must be solid and clearly distinct from one another. The cube must either have colored stickers or colored tiles.<br>
<br>
Puzzles may be made smoother internally by sanding or using any lubricant. No modifications are allowed that enhance the basic concept of the puzzle. Puzzles may not have any textures or markings that distinguish one piece from another.<br>
Any modifications to a puzzle that result in poor performance or results by a competitor are not grounds for additional chances to compete in any given round and turn.<br>
<br>
Puzzles must be approved by a judge before the competitor can compete.<br>

<h2>Article 4 Scrambling</h2>
The puzzles are to be scrambled using a computer-generated random scrambling algorithm. A scrambler must apply the scrambles.<br>
<br>
The number of moves varies for each puzzle:<br>

<br>
Every competitor has to solve the same scrambles per round.<br>

<h2>Article 5 Puzzle Defects</h2>
Puzzle defects are unintentional defects of puzzles (like: pieces popping, wires breaking, screws/caps/stickers falling off) that make it impossible or much harder to solve the puzzle.<br>
<br>
In ‘best of’ rounds solves with a puzzle defect cannot be exchanged by an extra attempt. If a puzzle defect occurs, the competitor may choose to repair the puzzle and continue the solve.<br>
<br>
In ‘average of’ rounds solves with a puzzle defect may be exchanged by an extra attempt, depending on the announcement for the competition. There may be maximum 1 extra attempt per round.<br>
<br>
In case of puzzle defects, the following rules must be followed:
<ul>
<li>In order for the competitor to declare a puzzle defect, he must declare the puzzle defect ten seconds after the puzzle defect occurs or three seconds after the reassembly of the puzzle.</li>
<li>If a non functional part of the puzzle is defect (like a center cap of a cube) during the solve, the competitor may continue the solve at his own discretion.</li>
<li>If a functional part of the puzzle is defect (like a piece popping) during the solve, the competitor may repair his puzzle and continue the solve at his own discretion.</li>
<li>If a competitor chooses to repair the puzzle, then he may only repair the defective pieces. After repairing the puzzle, the position may not intentionally be easier to solve than before the defect. If during the solve, the competitor notices that the puzzle is unsolvable, he may disassemble and assemble max. 3 pieces to make it solvable again. The puzzle must be completely solved, except for non functional pieces, when the time is stopped.</li>
<li>A judge may decide not to award an extra attempt if the competitor’s puzzle defect is ruled intentional under discretion of the judge. The judge may disqualify a solve if the competitor’s puzzle defect is ruled intentional under discretion of the judge.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Article 6 Awards/prizes/honors</h2>
Awards, prizes or honors may be given to competitors according to the announcement of the competition.<br>
Competitors must attend the winner’s ceremony to be eligible for awards/prizes/honors.

<h2>Article 7 Environment</h2>
Competitions can be held on any location, inside or outside, on special stages or normal floors. Audience must be at least 5 feet away from the competitors.<br>
Lighting of the competition area needs special attention, with preferably white light, so that competitors can easily distinguish the colors of puzzles.<br>
The timer is placed on a table, desk or console with a maximum height of 1 meter (allowance of 1.05 meter).<br>
Competitors may choose to solve while sitting or while standing. The timing device may be placed at a height that makes it less convenient to start/stop the timer while sitting.<br>

<h2>Article A: Speed Solving</h2>
Events categorized under Speed Solving must abide to the following procedure:<br>

<h3>Scrambling</h3>
The competitor hands over the puzzle to the judge and waits in the designated area until he can compete.<br>
A scrambler scrambles the cube according to the rules in Article 4.<br>
The competitor may not see the puzzle while it is being scrambled or before the inspection period.<br>
All scrambled puzzles must be checked for correct scrambling by the judge.

<h3>Preinspection</h3>
Each competitor will be allotted 15 seconds (timed to the nearest second) to inspect the scrambled puzzle. During this inspection time, the competitor is allowed to pick up the puzzle, but he may not manipulate the puzzle in anyway. If the competitor manipulates the puzzle, he is disqualified.<br>
<br>
The competitor may end inspection any time before the 15 seconds have passed.<br>
5 seconds before the allotted 15 seconds are over, the judge timing the inspection time says “5 seconds”. As soon as the 15-second inspection period has expired, the competitor has 2 seconds (timed mentally by the judge) to place the puzzle down. If he does not comply, the judge adds a 2 second penalty to the competitor’s final solve time. If the competitor still does not place the cube down 5 seconds (timed mentally by the judge) after the 15-second inspection period has expired, the judge, after consulting with the main judge of the event, may disqualify the solve.

<h3>Starting the Solve</h3>
After the inspection period, the competitor shall place the puzzle back onto the timing pad in the orientation and position he wishes to begin the solve. The judge covers the puzzle with hand or sheet of paper, in order to obstruct the competitor’s view of the puzzle. The judge may not move the puzzle nor make any rotations or manipulations of the puzzle.<br>
<br>
The competitor shall place his hands flat on the sensors of the pad with the palms down. The competitor may not have any physical contact with the puzzle before he begins the solve.<br>
<br>
The judge confirms that the timing pad has been reset and is ready for use.<br>
When the judge and the competitor mutually agree that the competitor is ready to begin the solve, the judge says “Ready?”. When the competitor confirms, the judge uncovers the puzzle after 1 second.<br>
<br>
The competitor has 3 seconds to begin his solve after the puzzle is uncovered. If the competitor does not begin his solve after 3 seconds (timed mentally by the judge), the judge may add 2 seconds to the competitor’s solve time. If the competitor does not begin the solve 7 seconds after the judge has removed his hand from the cube, the judge, after consulting with the main judge of the event, may disqualify the solve.

<h3>During the Solve</h3>
While solving the puzzle, the competitor may not have any communication with anyone other than the judge.<br>
While solving the puzzle, the competitor may not have any assistance from anyone.<br>

<h3>Ending the Solve</h3>
The competitor ends the solve by placing the puzzle back onto the timing pad and then stopping the timing pad by returning both hands flat to the sensors of the pad. It is the competitor’s responsibility to return his hands accurately and completely to the sensors of the pad.<br>
<br>
After the competitor stops the timer, he may not touch the puzzle until the judge has inspected the puzzle. A judge may disqualify a solve for touching the puzzle before he has inspected the puzzle. If a competitor manipulates the puzzle after the timer has been stopped, the solve is automatically disqualified.<br>
<br>
The judge inspects the puzzle and determines whether or not it has been completely solved. The competitor may pick up his puzzle only after the judge has inspected the puzzle.<br>

<h3>Solved State</h3>
For each puzzle the solved state must be clear to all competitors before the competition.<br>
<br>
Cubes are solved when all sides are restored to solid color states. All pieces of the cube must be attached to the cube for it to be solved. If a piece of the cube is ejected as the cube is placed down but it otherwise solved, the cube is not considered to be in a solved state. If a non functional part of a puzzle is defect/ejected, then the puzzle is considered solved, under discretion of the judge.<br>
<br>
A face of the cube may be misaligned in the following manner. The inner corner of the cube on the misaligned face may not cross the inner edge of the corresponding middle slice.<br>
Examples:<br>
<table>
<tr>
<td>Solved<br><img src="images/solved.jpg"></td>
<td>Not solved<br><img src="images/not_solved.jpg"></td>
</tr>
</table>
If a side is misaligned by more than the above criteria, then this position is considered one turn away.
If a cube is one turn from completion, 2 seconds will be added to the solve time. In all other cases, the solve is disqualified.<br>
Only the resting state of the cube is considered. The cube must come to a complete stop in its solved state in order for the cube to be solved.<br>
<br>
For Rubik’s Magic the puzzle must be flat on the surface when starting and ending the solve. The maximum elevation of any part of the Magic at the end of a solve is twice the thickness of the Magic puzzle.<br>
<br>
Other puzzles are solved according to the solved position defined in the announcement of the competition.<br>

<h3>Administration</h3>
The judge writes down the result of the solve on a competition sheet.<br>
At the end of a competitor’s round the judge delivers the competition sheet to the score taker.

<h2>Article B: Blindfolded Solving</h2>
Events categorized under Blindfolded Solving must abide to the following procedure:<br>

<h3>Scrambling</h3>
See Article A.

<h3>Starting the Solve</h3>
The judge places the scrambled puzzle (covered with a sheet of paper) in front of the competitor.<br>
<br>
The competitor places his hands flat on the surface on which the puzzle rests with the palms down. The competitor may not touch the puzzle at this point.<br>
<br>
After the judge and the competitor have mutually agreed that the competitor is ready to begin his solve, the judge gives a 3-second countdown. After the countdown, the judge uncovers the puzzle and at the same time starts the timer. (In case of a timer pad, the judge uncovers the puzzle as soon as the competitor removes his hands from the timer pad.)<br>

<h3>Memorization</h3>
The competitor memorizes the puzzle status. The competitor may pick up the puzzle, but he may not do any moves or manipulations on the puzzle. The competitor may not make notes.

<h3>During the Solve</h3>
After memorization the competitor dons the blindfold (provided by judge). The competitor may manipulate the puzzle only after the judge has verified that the competitor has properly donned the blindfold. The judge shall not delay the competitor by more than 1 second.<br>
<br>
While solving the puzzle, the competitor may not have any communication with anyone other than the judge.<br>
<br>
While solving the puzzle, the competitor may not have any assistance from anyone.<br>
<br>
The competitor may not look at the puzzle state at any time during the solve.<br>

<h3>Ending the Solve</h3>
The competitor ends the solve by placing the puzzle back onto the surface. The judge stops the timer after the competitor no longer has any physical contact with the puzzle and verifies verbally that the solve is completed. The judge also gives a verbal confirmation that the timer has been stopped. (In case of a timer pad, the competitor stops the time by placing his hands on the timer pad.)<br>
<br>
When the timer has stopped, the competitor may not touch the puzzle until the judge has inspected the puzzle. A judge may disqualify a solve for touching the puzzle before he has inspected the cube. If a competitor manipulates the puzzle after the timer has been stopped, the solve is automatically disqualified.<br>
<br>
The competitor may remove his blindfold.

<h3>Administration</h3>
See Article A.

<h2>Article C: One-handed solving</h2>
Events categorized under One-handed Solving must abide to the following procedure:<br>
<br>
See Article A.<br>
<br>
During the solve the competitor may only use one hand. No other body part or the table or any other available object may touch the puzzle. Once a competitor touches the puzzle with one hand, he may not touch the puzzle with the other hand.

<h2>Article D: Solving with feet</h2>
Events categorized under Solving with feet must abide to the following procedure:<br>
<br>
See Article A.<br>
<br>
The judge places the puzzle on a surface. During the solve the competitor may only use his feet and the surface. No other body parts or other available objects may touch the puzzle.

<h2>Article E: Solving using fewest moves</h2>
Events categorized under Solving using fewest moves must abide to the following procedure:<br>
<br>
See Article A.<br>
<br>
The judge hands a scramble algorithm to all competitors. The judge starts the timer and says "Go".<br>
The competitor has 90 minutes total time for solving the scramble in as few moves as possible. At the end of the 90 minutes the competitor must have his solution written down clearly for the judge.<br>
The metrics to measure the length of the solution, is half turn metrics, with slice moves counting as 2 moves.<br>
The solution of the competitor may not be in any way related to the scrambling algorithm. The competitor must be able to give a clear explanation of the solution.<br>
<br>
The competitor can use the following props: paper and pen (both supplied by judge), 3 cubes (self supplied). If the competitor uses other props, then he will be disqualified.
