</table>

<h2>Article A: Speed Solving</h2>
Events categorised under Speed Solving must abide to the following procedure:<br>

<h3>Scrambling</h3>
The competitor hands over the puzzle to the judge and waits in the designated area until he can compete.<br>
A scrambler scrambles the puzzle according to the regulations in Article 4.<br>
The competitor may not see the puzzle while it is being scrambled or before the inspection phase.<br>
The judge places the puzzle onto the StackMat and covers it completely with hand or object.<br>

<h3>Inspection</h3>
Each competitor will be allotted 15 seconds (timed to the nearest second) to inspect the scrambled puzzle.<br>
<br>
During this inspection time, the competitor is allowed to pick up the puzzle, but he may not manipulate the puzzle in anyway. If the competitor manipulates the puzzle, the solve is disqualified.<br>
<br>
The competitor may end inspection any time before the 15 seconds have passed.<br>
5 seconds before the allotted 15 seconds are over, the judge timing the inspection time says "5 seconds". As soon as the 15 second inspection period has expired, the competitor has 2 seconds (timed mentally by the judge) to place the puzzle down. If he does not comply, the judge adds a 2 second penalty to the competitor's final solve time. If the competitor still does not place the cube down 5 seconds (timed mentally by the judge) after the 15-second inspection period has expired, the judge may disqualify the solve.

<h3>Starting the Solve</h3>
After the inspection period, the competitor shall place the puzzle back onto the StackMat in the orientation and position he wishes to begin the solve. The judge covers the puzzle completely with hand or object. The judge may not move the puzzle nor make any rotations or manipulations of the puzzle.<br>
<br>
On a StackMat Generation 1 timer, the competitor must place his hands flat on the StackMat timer, with his fingers touching the sensors and palms down. On a StackMat Generation 2 timer, the competitor must place his hands flat on the elevated area of the StackMat, with his fingers touching the sensors and palms down.<br>
The competitor may not have any physical contact with the puzzle before he begins the solve by starting the timer.<br>
<br>
The judge confirms that the timer has been reset and is ready for use.<br>
When the judge and the competitor mutually agree in a reasonable period that the competitor is ready to begin the solve, the judge says "Ready?". When the competitor confirms, the judge uncovers the puzzle after 1 second.<br>
<br>
The competitor has 3 seconds to begin his solve after the puzzle is uncovered. If the competitor does not begin his solve after 3 seconds (timed mentally by the judge), the judge may add 2 seconds to the competitor's solve time. If the competitor does not begin the solve 7 seconds after the judge uncovered the cube, the judge, after consulting with the main judge of the event, may disqualify the solve.

<h3>During the Solve</h3>
While solving the puzzle, the competitor may not have any communication with anyone other than the judge.<br>
While solving the puzzle, the competitor may not have any assistance from anyone or any object.<br>

<h3>Ending the Solve</h3>
The competitor ends the solve by placing the puzzle back onto the StackMat and then stopping the timer. The timer must be stopped with both hands flat, palms down and the fingers touching the timer sensors, and without touching the puzzle. It is the competitor's responsibility that the timer is stopped correctly.<br>
<br>
After the competitor stops the timer, he may not touch the puzzle or reset the timer until the judge has inspected the puzzle. A judge may disqualify a solve for touching the puzzle or resetting the timer before he has inspected the puzzle. If a competitor manipulates the puzzle after the timer has been stopped, before the judge has inspected the puzzle, the solve is automatically disqualified.<br>
<br>
The judge inspects the puzzle and determines whether or not it has been completely solved. The competitor may pick up his puzzle only after the judge has inspected the puzzle.<br>

<h3>Administration</h3>
The judge writes down the result of the solve on a competition sheet. The competitor is responsible for checking the result on the sheet, immediately after the judge has written it down.<br>
At the end of a competitor's round the judge delivers the competition sheet to the score taker.

<h2>Article B: Blindfolded Solving</h2>
See Article A. Additional/special regulations for Blindfolded Solving:<br>

<h3>Starting the Solve</h3>
All times under 10 minutes must be done on a StackMat timer.<br>
If it is uncertain that the competitor will stay under 10 minutes, then the judge will use a stopwatch in addition to the StackMat timer. In that case the StackMat time counts for times under 10 minutes, and the stopwatch time for times over 10 minutes.<br>
If it is clear that the competitor will exceed 10 minutes, then the judge will use a stopwatch instead of a StackMat timer. In case the competitor solves under 10 minutes, then 10 minutes will be his time.<br>
<br>
When using a stopwatch only, the judge places the puzzle on the surface and covers the puzzle completely with hand or object. The judge may not move the puzzle nor make any rotations or manipulations of the puzzle. The competitor places his hands flat on the surface with the palms down. The competitor may not touch the puzzle.<br>
The judge confirms that the stopwatch has been reset and is ready for use.<br>
When the judge and the competitor mutually agree in a reasonable period that the competitor is ready to begin the solve, the judge says "Ready?". When the competitor confirms, the judge uncovers the puzzle after 1 second. At the same time the judge starts the stopwatch.<br>
<br>

<h3>Memorisation</h3>
The competitor memorises the puzzle status. The competitor may pick up the puzzle, but he may not do any moves or manipulations on the puzzle. The competitor may not make notes.

<h3>During the Solve</h3>
After memorisation the competitor dons the blindfold (provided by judge). The competitor may manipulate the puzzle only after the judge has verified that the competitor has properly donned the blindfold. The judge shall not delay the competitor by more than 1 second.<br>
<br>
The competitor may not look at the puzzle state at any time during the solve.<br>

<h3>Ending the Solve</h3>
When using a stopwatch only, the competitor ends the solve by placing the puzzle back onto the surface. The judge stops the timer after the competitor no longer has any physical contact with the puzzle and verifies verbally that the solve is completed. The judge also gives a verbal confirmation that the timer has been stopped.<br>
<br>
The competitor may remove his blindfold after the solve.

<h2>Article C: One-handed Solving</h2>
See Article A. Additional/special regulations for One-handed Solving:<br>
<br>
During the inspection and solve the competitor may only use one hand.<br>
During the solve no other body part or the table or any other available object may touch the puzzle. Once a competitor touches the puzzle with one hand, he may not touch the puzzle with the other hand.<br>
If the competitor drops the puzzle unintentionally during a solve, the competitor may start doing moves again when the puzzle has no contact with the surface anymore.<br>

<h2>Article D: Solving With Feet</h2>
See Article A. Additional/special regulations for Solving With Feet:<br>
<br>
All times under 10 minutes must be done on a StackMat timer.<br>
If it is uncertain that the competitor will stay under 10 minutes, then the judge will use a stopwatch in addition to the StackMat timer. In that case the StackMat time counts for times under 10 minutes, and the stopwatch time for times over 10 minutes.<br>
If it is clear that the competitor will exceed 10 minutes, then the judge will use a stopwatch instead of a StackMat timer. In case the competitor solves under 10 minutes, then 10 minutes will be his time.<br>
See also Article B.<br>
<br>
The judge places the puzzle on a surface.<br>
During the inspection and solve the competitor may only use his bare feet (with or without synthetic/woolen/cotton socks) and the surface. No other body parts or other available objects may touch the puzzle.<br>
The competitor may solve while sitting in a chair, sitting on the surface or standing.<br>

<h2>Article E: Fewest Moves Solving</h2>
See Article A. Additional/special regulations for Fewest Moves Solving:<br>
<br>
The judge hands a scramble algorithm to all competitors. The judge starts the stopwatch and says "Go".<br>
The competitor has 60 minutes total time for solving the scramble in as few moves as possible. At the end of the 60 minutes the competitor must have his solution written down clearly for the judge, UDFBRL notation.<br>
The metrics to measure the length of the solution, is half turn metrics, with slice moves counting as 2 moves.<br>
The solution of the competitor may not be in any way related to the scrambling algorithm. The competitor must be able to give a clear explanation of the solution.<br>
<br>
