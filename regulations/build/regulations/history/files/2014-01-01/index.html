</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9f"><a href="#9f">9f</a>) The results of a round are measured as follows:
<ul>
<li id="9f1"><a href="#9f1">9f1</a>) All timed results under 10 minutes are measured and truncated to the nearest hundredth of a second. All timed averages and means under 10 minutes are measured and rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second.</li>
<li id="9f2"><a href="#9f2">9f2</a>) All timed results, averages, and means over 10 minutes are measured and rounded to the nearest second (e.g. x.4 becomes x, x.5 becomes x+1).</li>
<li id="9f4"><a href="#9f4">9f4</a>) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNF (Did Not Finish) if the attempt is disqualified or unsolved/unfinished.</li>
<li id="9f5"><a href="#9f5">9f5</a>) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNS (Did Not Start) if the competitor is eligible for an attempt but declines it.</li>
<li id="9f6"><a href="#9f6">9f6</a>) For &quot;Best of X&quot; rounds, each competitor is allotted X attempts. The best result of these attempts counts for the competitor's ranking in the round.</li>
<li id="9f7"><a href="#9f7">9f7</a>) For &quot;Best of X&quot; rounds, a DNF or DNS is the worst possible result.</li>
<li id="9f8"><a href="#9f8">9f8</a>) For &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, competitors are allotted 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempts is removed, and the arithmetic mean of the remaining 3 attempts counts for the competitor's ranking in the round.</li>
<li id="9f9"><a href="#9f9">9f9</a>) For &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, one DNF or DNS is permitted to count as the competitor's worst result of the round. If a competitor has more than one DNF and/or DNS result in the round, his average score for the round is DNF.</li>
<li id="9f10"><a href="#9f10">9f10</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; rounds competitors are allotted 3 attempts. The arithmetic mean of the 3 attempts counts for the competitor's ranking in the round.</li>
<li id="9f11"><a href="#9f11">9f11</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; rounds, if the competitor has at least one DNF or DNS result, his average score for the round is DNF.</li>
<li id="9f12"><a href="#9f12">9f12</a>) For &quot;Best of X&quot; rounds, rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor. The following are used to compare results:
<ul>
<li id="9f12a"><a href="#9f12a">9f12a</a>) For timed results, &quot;better&quot; is defined as the shorter time.</li>
<li id="9f12b"><a href="#9f12b">9f12b</a>) For Fewest Moves Solving, &quot;better&quot; is defined as the shorter solution length.</li>
<li id="9f12c"><a href="#9f12c">9f12c</a>) For Multiple Blindfolded Solving, rankings are assessed based on number of puzzles solved minus the number of puzzles not solved, where a greater difference is better. If the difference is less than 0, or if only 1 puzzle is solved, the attempt is considered unsolved (DNF). If competitors achieve the same result, rankings are assessed based on total time, where the shorter recorded time is better. If competitors achieve the same result and the same time, rankings are assessed based on the number of puzzles the competitors failed to solve, where fewer unsolved puzzles is better.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9f13"><a href="#9f13">9f13</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; and &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, rankings are assessed based on the ordering of the averages/means of the competitors, where &quot;better&quot; is the shorter recorded time.</li>
<li id="9f14"><a href="#9f14">9f14</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; and &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, if two or more competitors achieve identical average/mean results, rankings are assessed based on the best attempt per competitor, where &quot;better&quot; is defined as the shorter time.</li>
<li id="9f15"><a href="#9f15">9f15</a>) Competitors who achieve the same result in a round receive an identical ranking for the round.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9g"><a href="#9g">9g</a>) A Combined Round consists of two phases of attempts, where competitors advance to the second phase if they meet a designated cutoff during the first phase.
<ul>
<li id="9g2"><a href="#9g2">9g2</a>) Whether a competitor proceeds to next phase of a Combined round, must be decided by ranking (best x competitors) or by result (all competitors with a best result under x) of the first phase.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9i"><a href="#9i">9i</a>) Results of official WCA competitions must be listed on the WCA world rankings.
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li id="9o"><a href="#9o">9o</a>) Combined rounds count as one round when counting the number of rounds per event.</li>
<li id="9p"><a href="#9p">9p</a>) If an event has multiple rounds, then:
<ul>
<li id="9p1"><a href="#9p1">9p1</a>) At least 25% of competitors must be eliminated between consecutive rounds of the same event.</li>
<li id="9p2"><a href="#9p2">9p2</a>) The competitors who advance to the next round must be determined by either a cutoff ranking or a cutoff time in the preceding elimination round.</li>
<li id="9p3"><a href="#9p3">9p3</a>) If a qualifying competitor withdraws from a round, he may be replaced by the best-ranked competitor below the cutoff from the preceding round.</li>

<li id="A1a2"><a href="#A1a2">A1a2</a>) Cumulative time limits may be enforced (e.g. 3 solves with a cumulative time limit of 20 minutes). The time elapsed in a DNF result counts towards the cumulative time limit.</li>
<li id="A1a3"><a href="#A1a3">A1a3</a>) For each round, any time limits must be announced before the round starts, and should not be changed after it has begun. Changes must be made at the discretion of the WCA Delegate, who must carefully consider the fairness of the change.</li>
<li id="A1a4"><a href="#A1a4">A1a4</a>) The competitor must end each solve within the time limit. If a competitor reaches the time limit for a solve/round, the judge stops the attempt immediately and records the result as DNF. Exception: Multiple Blindfolded Solving (see <a href="./#H1b1">Regulation H1b1</a>).</li>
<li id="A1a5"><a href="#A1a5">A1a5</a>) A solve is considered to meet the time limit if and only if the final result, after any time penalties are applied, is less than the time limit. Exception: Multiple Blindfolded Solving (see <a href="./#H1b1">Regulation H1b1</a>).</li>

<ul>
<li id="A1b1"><a href="#A1b1">A1b1</a>) For events with inspection, a Stackmat timer must be used in addition to the stopwatch. For events without inspection where the competitor is expected to exceed 10 minutes, use of the Stackmat is optional.</li>
<li id="A1b2"><a href="#A1b2">A1b2</a>) If a time from the Stackmat timer is available, it is the original recorded time. Otherwise, the stopwatch time is the original recorded time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A1c"><a href="#A1c">A1c</a>) A competitor participating in an event must be able to fulfill the event's requirements (e.g. know how to solve the puzzle). A competitor competing with expectation of a DNF result may be disqualified from the event, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A2"><a href="#A2">A2</a>) Scrambling:
<ul>
<li id="A2a"><a href="#A2a">A2a</a>) When called for a round, the competitor submits his puzzle, in its solved state, to the scrambler and waits in the Competitors Area until he is called to compete.</li>
<li id="A2b"><a href="#A2b">A2b</a>) A scrambler scrambles the puzzle according to the regulations in <a href="./#4">Article 4</a>.</li>
<li id="A2c"><a href="#A2c">A2c</a>) After the scrambler starts scrambling the puzzle, the competitor must not see the puzzle until the inspection phase starts.
<ul>
<li id="A2c1"><a href="#A2c1">A2c1</a>) The scrambler places a cover over the scrambled puzzle that makes it impossible for any competitors or spectators to see any part of the puzzle. The cover remains over the puzzle until the beginning of the attempt.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A2d"><a href="#A2d">A2d</a>) When taking a puzzle from the scrambler, the judge briefly inspects the puzzle to ensure thorough scrambling of the puzzle. The judge raises any concerns with the scrambler, who then conducts a detailed check.</li>
<li id="A2e"><a href="#A2e">A2e</a>) The judge places the puzzle onto the mat in an arbitrary orientation while ensuring that it remains completely covered.
<ul>
<li id="A2e1"><a href="#A2e1">A2e1</a>) The competitor is not permitted to request a specific orientation, and the judge must not influence the orientation he places the puzzle on the mat based on what he knows or expects the puzzle state to be.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A3"><a href="#A3">A3</a>) Inspection:

<ul>
<li id="A3b1"><a href="#A3b1">A3b1</a>) When the judge believes the competitor is ready, he asks &quot;READY?&quot;. The competitor must be ready to start the attempt within one minute of being called, else he forfeits his attempt (DNS), at the discretion of the judge.</li>
<li id="A3b2"><a href="#A3b2">A3b2</a>) The competitor begins the attempt by confirming his readiness, and the judge uncovers the puzzle and begins timing the inspection.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A3c"><a href="#A3c">A3c</a>) The competitor may pick up the puzzle during inspection.
<ul>
<li id="A3c1"><a href="#A3c1">A3c1</a>) The competitor must not apply moves during inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
<li id="A3c2"><a href="#A3c2">A3c2</a>) If the parts of the puzzle are not fully aligned, then the competitor may align the faces, as long as misalignments stay within the limits of <a href="./#10f">Regulation 10f</a>.</li>
<li id="A3c3"><a href="#A3c3">A3c3</a>) The competitor may reset the timer before he starts the solve.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li id="A3d1"><a href="#A3d1">A3d1</a>) The puzzle must not rest on the timer. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).</li>
<li id="A3d2"><a href="#A3d2">A3d2</a>) When 8 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls &quot;8 SECONDS&quot;.</li>
<li id="A3d3"><a href="#A3d3">A3d3</a>) When 12 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls &quot;12 SECONDS&quot;.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A4"><a href="#A4">A4</a>) Starting the solve:
<ul>
<li id="A4b"><a href="#A4b">A4b</a>) The competitor places his hands on the elevated sensor unit of the timer. His fingers must be touching the sensors with palms down. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
<ul>
<li id="A4b1"><a href="#A4b1">A4b1</a>) The competitor must have no physical contact with the puzzle between the inspection period and the beginning of the solve. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A4d"><a href="#A4d">A4d</a>) If a Stackmat timer is in use, the competitor starts the solve by confirming that the timer light is green and then removing his hands from the timer (thus starting the timer).
<ul>
<li id="A4d1"><a href="#A4d1">A4d1</a>) The competitor must start the solve within 15 seconds of the beginning of the inspection. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).</li>
<li id="A4d2"><a href="#A4d2">A4d2</a>) The competitor must start the solve within 17 seconds of the beginning of the inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
<li id="A4d3"><a href="#A4d3">A4d3</a>) If a stopwatch is in use, the judge starts the stopwatch as soon as the competitor starts the solve.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A4e"><a href="#A4e">A4e</a>) Time penalties for starting the solve are cumulative.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A5"><a href="#A5">A5</a>) During the solve:
<ul>
<li id="A5a"><a href="#A5a">A5a</a>) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not communicate with anyone other than the judge. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
<li id="A5b"><a href="#A5b">A5b</a>) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not receive assistance from anyone or any object other than the surface (also see <a href="./#2i">Regulation 2i</a>). Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A6"><a href="#A6">A6</a>) Stopping the solve:
<ul>
<li id="A6a"><a href="#A6a">A6a</a>) The competitor stops the solve by releasing the puzzle and then stopping the timer. The judge stops the stopwatch as soon as the competitor does this.
<ul>
<li id="A6a1"><a href="#A6a1">A6a1</a>) When using a stopwatch as the only timer, the competitor ends the solve by releasing the puzzle and notifying the judge that he has stopped the solve. The judge stops the stopwatch as soon as the competitor does this.</li>
<li id="A6a2"><a href="#A6a2">A6a2</a>) When using a stopwatch as the only timer, the competitor's default notification signal consists of releasing the puzzle(s) in his hand and placing his hands on the surface, with palms down. The competitor and the judge may agree on another appropriate notification before the beginning of the attempt.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A6b"><a href="#A6b">A6b</a>) The competitor is responsible for stopping the Stackmat timer correctly.
<ul>
<li id="A6b1"><a href="#A6b1">A6b1</a>) If the timer stops before the end of the solve and the timer shows a time strictly below 0.06 seconds, then the attempt is replaced by an extra attempt. A competitor forfeits his right to the additional attempt if the WCA Delegate determines that the timer was stopped deliberately.</li>
<li id="A6b2"><a href="#A6b2">A6b2</a>) If the timer stops before the end of the solve and displays a time of 0.06 seconds or higher, then the attempt is disqualified (DNF). Exception: if the competitor can demonstrate that the timer malfunctioned, he may receive an extra attempt, at the WCA Delegate's discretion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A6c"><a href="#A6c">A6c</a>) The competitor must fully release the puzzle before stopping the solve. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).</li>
<li id="A6d"><a href="#A6d">A6d</a>) The competitor must stop the timer using both hands, placed flat on the sensors with palms down. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).</li>
<li id="A6e"><a href="#A6e">A6e</a>) The competitor must not touch or move the puzzle until the judge has inspected the puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF). Exception: If no moves have been applied, a time penalty (+2 seconds) may be assigned instead, at the discretion of the judge.</li>
<li id="A6f"><a href="#A6f">A6f</a>) The competitor must not reset the timer until the judge has recorded the result on the score sheet. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF), at the discretion of the judge.</li>
<li id="A6g"><a href="#A6g">A6g</a>) The judge determines whether the puzzle is solved. He must not make moves or align faces when examining the puzzle.</li>
<li id="A6h"><a href="#A6h">A6h</a>) In case of a dispute, moves or alignments must not be applied to the puzzle before the dispute is resolved.</li>
<li id="A6i"><a href="#A6i">A6i</a>) Time penalties for stopping the solve are cumulative.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A7"><a href="#A7">A7</a>) Recording results:
<ul>
<li id="A7a"><a href="#A7a">A7a</a>) The judge tells the competitor the result.
<ul>
<li id="A7a1"><a href="#A7a1">A7a1</a>) If the judge finds that the puzzle is solved, he calls &quot;OKAY&quot;.</li>
<li id="A7a2"><a href="#A7a2">A7a2</a>) If the judge assigns any penalties, the judge calls &quot;PENALTY&quot;.</li>
<li id="A7a3"><a href="#A7a3">A7a3</a>) If the result is DNF, the judge calls &quot;DNF&quot;.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A7b"><a href="#A7b">A7b</a>) The judge records the result on a score sheet.
<ul>
<li id="A7b1"><a href="#A7b1">A7b1</a>) If penalties are assigned, the judge records the original recorded result displayed on the timer, along with any penalties. The format should be &quot;X + T + Y = F&quot;, where X represents the sum of time penalties before/starting the solve, T represents the time displayed on the timer (the &quot;original recorded time&quot;), Y represents a sum of time penalties during/after the solve, and F represents the final result. If X and/or Y is 0, the 0 terms are omitted (e.g. 2 + 17.65 + 2 = 21.65, or 17.65 + 2 = 19.65).</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A7c"><a href="#A7c">A7c</a>) The judge and competitor must each check the recorded result, and sign (or initial) the score sheet to acknowledge that the result is correct, complete, properly formatted, and clearly readable. This finishes the attempt.
<ul>
<li id="A7c1"><a href="#A7c1">A7c1</a>) If the competitor or the judge refuses to accept and sign the score sheet, the WCA Delegate must resolve the dispute.</li>
<li id="A7c2"><a href="#A7c2">A7c2</a>) The competitor must not sign an attempt on the score sheet before the judge has recorded the final result for that attempt. If a competitor signs (or otherwise marks) an attempt before he has begun it, or before the judge has finished recording the result, he forfeits the attempt and the result will be considered DNS.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A7f"><a href="#A7f">A7f</a>) When a competitor's score sheet for a round is complete, the judge delivers the score sheet to the score taker.</li>
