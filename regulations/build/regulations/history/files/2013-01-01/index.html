<ul>
<li id="9a"><a href="#9a">9a</a>) The WCA governs competitions for:
<ul>
<li id="9a1"><a href="#9a1">9a1</a>) Puzzles known as Rubik's puzzles.</li>
<li id="9a2"><a href="#9a2">9a2</a>) Other puzzles that are manipulated by twisting the sides, commonly known as &quot;twisty puzzles&quot;.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9b"><a href="#9b">9b</a>) The official puzzles and event formats of the WCA are:
<ul>
<li id="9b1"><a href="#9b1">9b1</a>) Rubik's Cube, 2x2x2 Cube, 4x4x4 Cube, 5x5x5 Cube, Clock, Megaminx, Pyraminx, Square-1, and Rubik's Cube: One-Handed.
<ul>
<li id="9b1a"><a href="#9b1a">9b1a</a>) Competition formats for these events are: &quot;Best of X&quot; (where X is 1, 2, or 3), and &quot;Average of 5&quot;.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9b2"><a href="#9b2">9b2</a>) Rubik's Cube: With Feet, 6x6x6 Cube, and 7x7x7 Cube.
<ul>
<li id="9b2a"><a href="#9b2a">9b2a</a>) Competition formats for these events are: &quot;Best of X&quot; (where X is 1, 2, or 3) and &quot;Mean of 3&quot;.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9b3"><a href="#9b3">9b3</a>) Rubik's Cube: Fewest Moves, Rubik's Cube: Blindfolded, 4x4x4 Cube: Blindfolded, 5x5x5 Cube: Blindfolded, and Rubik's Cube: Multiple Blindfolded.
<ul>
<li id="9b3a"><a href="#9b3a">9b3a</a>) Competition formats for these events are: &quot;Best of X&quot; (where X is 1, 2, or 3).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9f"><a href="#9f">9f</a>) The results of a round are measured as follows:
<ul>
<li id="9f1"><a href="#9f1">9f1</a>) All timed results under 10 minutes are measured and rounded down to the nearest hundredth of a second. All timed averages and means under 10 minutes are measured and rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second.</li>
<li id="9f2"><a href="#9f2">9f2</a>) All timed results, averages, and means over 10 minutes are measured and rounded to the nearest second (e.g. x.4 becomes x, x.5 becomes x+1).</li>
<li id="9f4"><a href="#9f4">9f4</a>) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNF (Did Not Finish) if the attempt is disqualified or unsolved/unfinished.</li>
<li id="9f5"><a href="#9f5">9f5</a>) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNS (Did Not Start) if the competitor is eligible for an attempt but declines it.</li>
<li id="9f6"><a href="#9f6">9f6</a>) For &quot;Best of X&quot; rounds, each competitor is allotted X attempts. The best result of these attempts counts for the competitor's ranking in the round.</li>
<li id="9f7"><a href="#9f7">9f7</a>) For &quot;Best of X&quot; rounds, a DNF or DNS is the worst possible result.</li>
<li id="9f8"><a href="#9f8">9f8</a>) For &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, competitors are allotted 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempts is removed, and the arithmetic mean of the remaining 3 attempts counts for the competitor's ranking in the round.</li>
<li id="9f9"><a href="#9f9">9f9</a>) For &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, one DNF or DNS is permitted to count as the competitor's worst result of the round. If a competitor has more than one DNF and/or DNS result in the round, his average score for the round is DNF.</li>
<li id="9f10"><a href="#9f10">9f10</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; rounds competitors are allotted 3 attempts. The arithmetic mean of the 3 attempts counts for the competitor's ranking in the round.</li>
<li id="9f11"><a href="#9f11">9f11</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; rounds, if the competitor has at least one DNF or DNS result, his average score for the round is DNF.</li>
<li id="9f12"><a href="#9f12">9f12</a>) For &quot;Best of X&quot; rounds, rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor. The following are used to compare results:
<ul>
<li id="9f12a"><a href="#9f12a">9f12a</a>) For timed results, &quot;better&quot; is defined as the shorter time.</li>
<li id="9f12b"><a href="#9f12b">9f12b</a>) For Fewest Moves Solving, &quot;better&quot; is defined as the shorter solution length.</li>
<li id="9f12c"><a href="#9f12c">9f12c</a>) For Multiple Blindfolded Solving, rankings are assessed based on number of puzzles solved minus the number of puzzles not solved, where a greater difference is better. If the difference is less than 0, the attempt is considered unsolved (DNF). If competitors achieve the same result, rankings are assessed based on total time, where the shorter recorded time is better. If competitors achieve the same result and the same time, rankings are assessed based on the number of puzzles the competitors failed to solve, where fewer unsolved puzzles is better.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9f13"><a href="#9f13">9f13</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; and &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, rankings are assessed based on the ordering of the averages/means of the competitors, where &quot;better&quot; is the shorter recorded time.</li>
<li id="9f14"><a href="#9f14">9f14</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; and &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, if two or more competitors achieve identical average/mean results, rankings are assessed based on the best attempt per competitor, where &quot;better&quot; is defined as the shorter time.</li>
<li id="9f15"><a href="#9f15">9f15</a>) Competitors who achieve the same result in a round receive an identical ranking for the round.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9g"><a href="#9g">9g</a>) A Combined Round consists of two phases of attempts, where competitors advance to the second phase if they meet a designated cutoff during the first phase.
<ul>
<li id="9g2"><a href="#9g2">9g2</a>) Whether a competitor proceeds to next phase of a Combined round, must be decided by ranking (best x competitors) or by result (all competitors with a best result under x) of the first phase.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9i"><a href="#9i">9i</a>) Results of official WCA competitions must be listed on the WCA world rankings.
<ul>
<li id="9i1"><a href="#9i1">9i1</a>) The WCA recognises the following types of regional records: national records, continental records, and world records.</li>
<li id="9i2"><a href="#9i2">9i2</a>) All the results of a round are considered to take place on the last calendar date of the round. If a regional record is broken multiple times on the same calendar date, only the best result is recognised as breaking that regional record.</li>
<li id="9i3"><a href="#9i3">9i3</a>) If the WCA Regulations for an event are changed, existing regional records stand until they are broken under the new WCA Regulations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9j"><a href="#9j">9j</a>) Each event must be held at most once per competition.</li>

<li id="9m3"><a href="#9m3">9m3</a>) Events with 7 or fewer competitors must have at most one round.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9o"><a href="#9o">9o</a>) Combined rounds and Qualification rounds each count as one round when counting the number of rounds per event.</li>
<li id="9p"><a href="#9p">9p</a>) If an event has multiple rounds, then:
<ul>
<li id="9p1"><a href="#9p1">9p1</a>) At least 25% of competitors must be eliminated between consecutive rounds of the same event.</li>
<li id="9p2"><a href="#9p2">9p2</a>) The competitors who advance to the next round must be determined by either a cutoff ranking or a cutoff time in the preceding elimination round.</li>
<li id="9p3"><a href="#9p3">9p3</a>) If a qualifying competitor withdraws from a round, he may be replaced by the best-ranked competitor below the cutoff from the preceding round.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9r"><a href="#9r">9r</a>) A qualification round must be held before the first round of the event.
<ul>
<li id="9r1"><a href="#9r1">9r1</a>) When announcing an event, the organisation team must include:

<li id="9r1d"><a href="#9r1d">9r1d</a>) The latest permitted date used to determine the qualifying average/mean result or single solve result in the WCA rankings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9r2"><a href="#9r2">9r2</a>) Each competitor of an event who has not directly qualified for the first round of the event must compete in the qualification round in order to participate in the first round.</li>
<li id="9r3"><a href="#9r3">9r3</a>) A qualification round may be added to specifically accommodate newly registered competitors, and/or the maximum number of competitors in the qualification round or first round of an event may be increased. These changes must be made at least two weeks before the competition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="9s"><a href="#9s">9s</a>) Each round of each event must have a time limit (see <a href="regulation:A1a">Regulation A1a</a>).</li>

<li id="11e"><a href="#11e">11e</a>) If an incident occurs during an attempt, the WCA Delegate may award a competitor an extra attempt, replacing the attempt during which the incident occurred. The competitor must appeal verbally or in writing to the judge and WCA Delegate at the time of the incident, before finishing the original attempt, to be eligible for an extra attempt. An appeal does not guarantee the competitor an extra attempt.
<ul>
<li id="11e1"><a href="#11e1">11e1</a>) If a competitor is awarded an extra attempt, the extra attempt must be scrambled using a different scramble sequence.

<ul>
<li id="A1"><a href="#A1">A1</a>) Speed Solving attempts must abide by the following procedure.
<ul>
<li id="A1a"><a href="#A1a">A1a</a>) The organisation team may enforce time limits for attempts and/or rounds.
<ul>
<li id="A1a1"><a href="#A1a1">A1a1</a>) The default time limit per attempt is 10 minutes, though the organisation team may announce a higher or lower time limit.</li>
<li id="A1a2"><a href="#A1a2">A1a2</a>) Cumulative time limits may be enforced (e.g. 3 attempts with a cumulative time limit of 20 minutes). The time elapsed in a DNF result counts towards the cumulative time limit.</li>
<li id="A1a3"><a href="#A1a3">A1a3</a>) For each round, any time limits must be announced before the round starts, and should not be changed after it has begun. Changes must be made at the discretion of the WCA Delegate, who must carefully consider the fairness of the change.</li>
<li id="A1a4"><a href="#A1a4">A1a4</a>) The competitor must end each attempt within the time limit. If a competitor reaches the time limit for an attempt/round, the judge stops the attempt immediately and record the result as DNF. Exception: Multiple Blindfolded Solving (see <a href="./#H1b1">Regulation H1b1</a>).</li>
<li id="A1a5"><a href="#A1a5">A1a5</a>) An attempt is considered to meet the time limit if and only if the final result, after any time penalties are applied, is less than the time limit. Exception: Multiple Blindfolded Solving (see <a href="./#H1b1">Regulation H1b1</a>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A1b"><a href="#A1b">A1b</a>) If the time limit for an attempt is greater than 10 minutes, a stopwatch must be used for timekeeping.
<ul>
<li id="A1b1"><a href="#A1b1">A1b1</a>) Simultaneous use of a Stackmat timer is optional.</li>
<li id="A1b2"><a href="#A1b2">A1b2</a>) If a time from the Stackmat timer is available, it is the original recorded time. Otherwise, the stopwatch time is the original recorded time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A1c"><a href="#A1c">A1c</a>) A competitor participating in an event must be able to fulfill the event's requirements (e.g. know how to solve the puzzle). A competitor competing with expectation of a DNF result may be disqualified from the event, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A2"><a href="#A2">A2</a>) Scrambling:
<ul>
<li id="A2a"><a href="#A2a">A2a</a>) When called for a round, the competitor submits his puzzle, in its solved state, to the scrambler and waits in the Competitors Area until he is called to compete.</li>
<li id="A2b"><a href="#A2b">A2b</a>) A scrambler scrambles the puzzle according to the regulations in <a href="./#4">Article 4</a>.</li>
<li id="A2c"><a href="#A2c">A2c</a>) After the scrambler starts scrambling the puzzle, the competitor must not see the puzzle until the inspection phase starts.
<ul>
<li id="A2c1"><a href="#A2c1">A2c1</a>) The scrambler places a cover over the scrambled puzzle that makes it impossible for any competitors or spectators to see any part of the puzzle. The cover remains over the puzzle until the beginning of the attempt.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A2d"><a href="#A2d">A2d</a>) When taking a puzzle from the scrambler, the judge briefly inspects the puzzle to ensure thorough scrambling of the puzzle. The judge raises any concerns with the scrambler, who then conducts a detailed check.</li>
<li id="A2e"><a href="#A2e">A2e</a>) The judge places the puzzle onto the mat in an arbitrary orientation and ensures that it is covered completely. The competitor is not permitted to request a specific orientation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A3"><a href="#A3">A3</a>) Inspection:
<ul>
<li id="A3a"><a href="#A3a">A3a</a>) The competitor may inspect the puzzle at the beginning of each attempt.
<ul>
<li id="A3a1"><a href="#A3a1">A3a1</a>) The competitor is allotted a maximum of 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle and start the solve.</li>
</ul></li>
<li id="A3b"><a href="#A3b">A3b</a>) Before the competitor starts the attempt, the judge resets the timer and, where applicable, the stopwatch.
