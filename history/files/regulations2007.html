Latest textual revision December 9, 2007<br>
To make the regulations easier to read we use 'he' where the reader should read 'she or he'.<br>
The use of the words 'must', 'must not', 'should', 'should not' and 'may' comply to <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt" target="_blank">RFC 2119</a>.<br>

<li>5b5) If after the solve non functional parts of the puzzle are still defect (like a center cap of a cube) or not fully rotated (like a 5x5x5 center piece twisted in its spot), but the puzzle is otherwise unambiguously solved, the puzzle is considered solved, under discretion of the main judge.</li>

<li>9f2) All timed results over 10 minutes, and corresponding averages are measured in seconds, with averages rounded to the nearest second (0.4 becomes 0, 0.5 becomes 1).</li>
<li>9f3) All counted results and averages are measured in natural numbers, with averages rounded to the nearest tenth (.04 becomes .0, .05 becomes .1).</li>
<li>9f4) DNF (Did Not Finish) is the result if the solve was disqualified or unfinished.</li>
<li>9f5) DNS (Did Not Start) is the result if a competitor skipped an attempt in a round.</li>
<li>9f6) In 'Best of x' rounds competitors get x attempts, with the best attempt counting. There may be a combined time limit, example: 30 minutes for 'Best of 1' or 'Best of 2'.</li>
<li>9f7) In 'Best of x' rounds a DNF or DNS is the worst result of a competitor, if all results are DNF and/or DNS the best result of the competitor is DNF.</li>
<li>9f8) In 'Average of 5' rounds competitors get 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempt are removed, with the average of the remaining 3 attempts counting.</li>
<li>9f9) In 'Average of 5' rounds one DNF or DNS is counted as the worst result, with more than one DNF and/or DNS the average is DNF.</li>
<li>9f10) In 'Mean of 3' rounds competitors get 3 attempts, with the mean of the 3 attempts counting.</li>
<li>9f11) In 'Mean of 3' rounds if the competitor has at least one DNF or DNS the mean is DNF.</li>
<li>9f12) In 'Best of x' rounds the order in the results is based on the best result per competitor, with lower meaning better.</li>
<li>9f13) In 'Mean of' and 'Average of' rounds the order in the results is based on the best average per competitor, with lower meaning better.</li>
<li>9f14) If in 'Mean of' and 'Average of' rounds competitors have the same average result, then the order in the results for these competitors is based on the best result per competitor, with lower meaning better.</li>
<li>9f15) Competitors with the same result in a round finish at the same position.</li>
<li>9f16) For the 3x3x3 Cube: Multiple Blindfolded event the order in the results is based on:<br>
Highest in the ranking are the competitors who solved all puzzles, among these competitors a larger number means better. For equal results the lower total time means better.<br>
Next in the ranking are the competitors who solved at least one of the puzzles, among these competitors a larger number of solved puzzles means better, and after this a lower number of attempted puzzles means better. For equal results the lower total time means better.<br>
