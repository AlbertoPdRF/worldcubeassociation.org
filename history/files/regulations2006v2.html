</table>

<h2>Article A: Speed Solving</h2>
Events categorised under Speed Solving must abide to the following procedure:<br>

<h3>Scrambling</h3>
The competitor hands over the puzzle to the judge and waits in the designated area until he is called to compete.<br>
A scrambler scrambles the puzzle according to the regulations in Article 4.<br>
The competitor must not see the puzzle while it is being scrambled or before the inspection phase.<br>
The judge does a quick general inspection of thorough scrambling of the puzzle. In case of doubt the judge contacts the scrambler for a detailed check.<br>
The judge places the puzzle onto the StackMat and covers it completely with hand or object.<br>

<h3>Inspection</h3>
Each competitor is allotted 15 seconds (timed to the nearest second) to inspect the scrambled puzzle.<br>
<br>
During this inspection time, the competitor is allowed to pick up the puzzle.<br>
The competitor must not manipulate the puzzle in anyway. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.<br>
If the pieces of the puzzle are not fully aligned, then the competitor may fix it, only to align the faces (for cubes the manipulation must not exceed limits given in article 10f).<br>
<br>
The competitor may end inspection any time before the 15 seconds have passed.<br>
5 seconds before the allotted 15 seconds are over, the judge says "5 seconds". As soon as the 15 second inspection period has expired, the competitor has 2 seconds (timed mentally by the judge) to place the puzzle down. If he does not comply, the judge adds a 2 second penalty to the competitor's final solve time. If the competitor still does not place the cube down 5 seconds (timed mentally by the judge) after the 15-second inspection period has expired, the judge may disqualify the solve.

<h3>Starting the Solve</h3>
After the inspection period, the competitor must place the puzzle back onto the StackMat in the orientation and position he wishes to begin the solve. The judge covers the puzzle completely with hand or object. The judge must not move the puzzle nor make any rotations or manipulations of the puzzle.<br>
<br>
On a StackMat Generation 1 timer, the competitor must place his hands flat on the StackMat timer, with his fingers touching the sensors and palms down. On a StackMat Generation 2 timer, the competitor must place his hands flat on the elevated area of the StackMat, with his fingers touching the sensors and palms down.<br>
The competitor must not have any physical contact with the puzzle before he begins the solve by starting the timer.<br>
<br>
The judge confirms that the timer has been reset and is ready for use.<br>
When the judge and the competitor mutually agree in a reasonable period that the competitor is ready to begin the solve, the judge says "Ready?". When the competitor confirms, the judge uncovers the puzzle after 1 second.<br>
<br>
The competitor must begin his solve within 3 seconds after the puzzle is uncovered. If the competitor does not begin his solve after 3 seconds (timed mentally by the judge), the judge may add 2 seconds to the competitor's solve time. If the competitor does not begin the solve 7 seconds after the judge uncovered the cube, the judge, after consulting with the main judge of the event, may disqualify the solve.

<h3>During the Solve</h3>
While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not have any communication with anyone other than the judge.<br>
While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not have any assistance from anyone or any object.<br>

<h3>Ending the Solve</h3>

The competitor ends the solve by releasing the puzzle and then stopping the timer.<br>
It is the competitor's responsibility that the timer is stopped correctly.<br>
a) The timer must be stopped using both hands, with both hands flat and palms down.<br>
b) The competitor must fully release the puzzle before stopping the timer.<br>
Penalty in case of violation of a), b) or both: 2 seconds.<br>
c) The competitor must not manipulate the puzzle until the judge has inspected the puzzle.<br>
Penalty: Disqualification of the solve.<br>
d) The competitor must not reset the timer until the judge has written down the result on the competition sheet.<br>
Penalty: Disqualification of the solve (courtesy of the judge).<br>
e) The judge must inspect the puzzle without manipulating it and must determine whether the puzzle has been completely solved.<br>
f) In case of a dispute the puzzle must not be manipulated until the dispute has been settled, involving the main judge if needed.<br>
Penalty: Disqualification of the solve (courtesy of the judge).<br>

<h3>Administration</h3>
The judge writes down the result of the solve on a competition sheet. The competitor is responsible for checking the result on the sheet, immediately after the judge has written it down.<br>
At the end of a competitor's round the judge delivers the competition sheet to the score taker.

<h2>Article B: Blindfolded Solving</h2>
See Article A. Additional/special regulations for Blindfolded Solving:<br>

<h3>Starting the Solve</h3>
All times under 10 minutes must be done on a StackMat timer.<br>
If it is uncertain that the competitor will stay under 10 minutes, then the judge should use a stopwatch in addition to the StackMat timer. In that case the StackMat time counts for times under 10 minutes, and the stopwatch time for times over 10 minutes.<br>
If it is clear that the competitor will exceed 10 minutes, then the judge should use a stopwatch instead of a StackMat timer. In case the competitor solves under 10 minutes, then 10 minutes will be his time.<br>
<br>
When using a stopwatch only, the judge places the puzzle on the surface and covers the puzzle completely with hand or object. The judge must not move the puzzle or make any rotations or manipulations of the puzzle. The competitor places his hands flat on the surface with the palms down. The competitor must not touch the puzzle.<br>
The judge confirms that the stopwatch has been reset and is ready for use.<br>
When the judge and the competitor mutually agree in a reasonable period that the competitor is ready to begin the solve, the judge says "Ready?". When the competitor confirms, the judge uncovers the puzzle after 1 second. At the same time the judge starts the stopwatch.<br>
<br>

<h3>Memorisation</h3>
The competitor memorises the puzzle status. The competitor may pick up the puzzle, but he must not do any moves or manipulations on the puzzle. The competitor must not make notes.

<h3>During the Solve</h3>
After memorisation the competitor dons the blindfold (provided by judge). The competitor may manipulate the puzzle only after the judge has verified that the competitor has properly donned the blindfold. The judge must not delay the competitor by more than 1 second.<br>
The competitor must not look at the puzzle state at any time during the solve.<br>
The competitor may remove the blindfold again, only before he has manipulated the puzzle.

<h3>Ending the Solve</h3>
When using the StackMat, the competitor ends the solve by releasing the puzzle and then stopping the timer.<br>
When using a stopwatch, the competitor ends the solve by placing the puzzle back onto the surface and notifying the judge that the solve has ended. At that moment the judge stops the timer.<br>
The competitor may remove the blindfold before the end of the solve, but after removing the blindfold the puzzle must not be manipulated anymore.
<br>

<h2>Article C: One-handed Solving</h2>
See Article A. Additional/special regulations for One-handed Solving:<br>
<br>
During the inspection and solve the competitor must only use one hand.<br>
During the solve no other body part or the table or any other available object must touch the puzzle. Once a competitor touches the puzzle with one hand, he must not touch the puzzle with the other hand.<br>
If the competitor drops the puzzle during a solve, the competitor must start doing moves again when the puzzle has no contact with the surface anymore.<br>

<h2>Article D: Solving With Feet</h2>
See Article A. Additional/special regulations for Solving With Feet:<br>
<br>
All times under 10 minutes must be done on a StackMat timer.<br>
If it is uncertain that the competitor will stay under 10 minutes, then the judge should use a stopwatch in addition to the StackMat timer. In that case the StackMat time counts for times under 10 minutes, and the stopwatch time for times over 10 minutes.<br>
If it is clear that the competitor will exceed 10 minutes, then the judge should use a stopwatch instead of a StackMat timer. In case the competitor solves under 10 minutes, then 10 minutes will be his time.<br>
See also Article B.<br>
<br>
The judge places the puzzle on a surface.<br>
During the inspection and solve the competitor must only use his bare feet (with or without synthetic/woolen/cotton socks) and the surface. No other body parts or other available objects must touch the puzzle.<br>
The competitor must solve while sitting in a chair, or sitting on the surface or standing.<br>

<h2>Article E: Fewest Moves Solving</h2>
See Article A. Additional/special regulations for Fewest Moves Solving:<br>
<br>
The judge hands a scramble algorithm to all competitors. The judge starts the stopwatch and says "Go".<br>
The competitor has 60 minutes total time for solving the scramble in as few moves as possible. At the end of the 60 minutes the competitor must have his solution written down clearly for the judge, UDFBRL notation.<br>
The metric to measure the length of the solution, is Half Turn Metric, with slice moves counting as 2 moves.<br>
The solution of the competitor must not be in any way related to the scrambling algorithm. The competitor must be able to give a clear explanation of the solution.<br>
<br>
The competitor may use the following objects: paper and pen (both supplied by judge), 3 cubes (self supplied), unlimited coloured stickers (self supplied).<br>
Penalty for using other objects: disqualification of the solve.

<h2>Article F: Clock Solving</h2>
