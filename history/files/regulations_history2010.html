<ul>
<li>Overall: Added the WCA logo.</li>
<li>Overall: Changed the style sheet so that the regulations are better printable.</li>
<li>Overall: Changed preinspection to inspection.</li>

<li>Art. 8d/e: Changed 'event' in 'round of an event'. The main judge decides whether the competitor can continue the round. Special case is when competitor had a puzzle defect.</li>
<li>Art. 9: Added preferred formats for all events.</li>

<li>Art. 9i: All competitors must compete in each round during the same time frame.

<li>Art. A: No explicit mention anymore of the judge having to check the scramble. This is both impractical and double work. Of course the judge should do a quick visual check whether the puzzle is scrambled at all.</li>
<li>Art. C: Textual change: of course the puzzle may touch the surface before and after inspection phase.</li>
<li>Art. C: Addition about moving after the puzzle has fallen.</li>
<li>Art. D: Explicit mention of sitting on surface or sitting in a chair.</li>
<li>Art. E: Extra stickers are allowed for Fewest Moves.</li>
<li>Art. G: New article: Rubik's 3x3x3 Cube No inspection.</li>

<ul>
<li>Different penalties for different puzzles.</li>
<li>No covering of the puzzles anymore after preinspection.</li>
<li>No change of metric for fewest moves.</li>
<li>No change in 'mean of 3'. Some people wanted a change to prevent the DNF's that we saw in recent competitions. WCA board thinks we should stay strict. We expect competitors to take fewer risks if we stay strict. And 'average of 5' for the bigger puzzles is very hard to fit in the time schedule.</li>
