<h1>World Cube Association Competition regulations, history of changes</h1>
<br>
History:<br>
<div class="note">
<br>
April 9, 2008: Final version for 2008, with the following changes:<br>
Main changes:<br>
<ul>
<li>All puzzle and sticker brands are allowed. WCA is brand neutral. [fairness]</li>
<li>Procedure for adding and removing events. Needed to handle new events. [fun]</li>
<li>Solved State: misalignment may now be halfway to the next face, but only one group of adjacent slices. Easier for judging resp. fairer for competitors. [fairness, clarity]</li>
<li>New starting procedure: puzzle is not covered anymore after inspection. Reduces interaction between judge and competitor. Reduces chance of judging errors in the procedure. [fairness, organisation]</li>
<li>Multiple Blindfolded solving: order of results has changed to number of solved puzzles minus number of unsolved puzzles. Time per cube is 10 minutes (was 15 minutes for first 6 cubes). [compromise]</li>
<li>Blindfolded solving: a sheet of paper (or similar object) is kept between face of competitor and puzzle. [cheating prevention]</li>
<li>Scrambling: Cube Explorer must be used for Rubik's Cube scramble sequences with better randomness of positions [fairness], and Stefan Pochmann's scrambler for Megaminx scramble sequences [organisation].</li>
<li>Definition of a competitors area where competitors must wait. [smoother procedures, cheating prevention]</li>
<li>Definition of qualification rounds. Needed to handle large numbers of competitors for an event. [organisation]</li>
<li>No B Finals anymore. Instead of B final it is better to have more competitors proceed to the next round. [clarity]</li>
<li>For one-handed solving it is now allowed to use both hands during inspection. Two handed inspection does not influence the result. [fairness]</li>
<li>More responsibilities to WCA delegate, fewer to organisation team. WCA delegate is more qualified for this. [fairness]</li>
<li>For blindfolded solving the competitor must remove the cover from the puzzle. Formerly the judge did that. [organisation]</li>
<li>Added a penalty for Rubik's Magic. [similarity to other puzzles]</li>
<li>Only Generation 2 and higher timers are allowed. [standardisation]</li>
<li>Some optional regulations to manage large competitions. [organisation]</li>

<ul>
<li>Overall: Added the Czech translation.</li>
<li>Overall: Removed the beta of the Korean translation.</li>
<li>Overall: Added the Pyraminx scrambling program by Syoji Takamatsu.</li>
</ul>

January 13, 2006: Final version for 2006, with the following changes:<br>
<ul>
<li>Overall: Added the WCA logo.</li>
<li>Overall: Changed the style sheet so that the regulations are better printable.</li>
<li>Overall: Changed preinspection to inspection.</li>
<li>Overall: All lines in the articles 1-10 have an article number.</li>
<li>Art. 1e: Clarification about judges and scramblers competing in a round.</li>
<li>Art. 5: No extra attempts anymore for puzzle defects in 'Average of 5' rounds.</li>
<li>Art. 5: Textual changes for clarification.</li>
<li>Art. 8: WCA delegates must approve all events and formats of the competition before the competition starts. This is to prevent special events without the normal competition pressure.</li>
<li>Art. 8d/e: Changed 'event' in 'round of an event'. The main judge decides whether the competitor can continue the round. Special case is when competitor had a puzzle defect.</li>
<li>Art. 9: Added preferred formats for all events.</li>
<li>Art. 9: Rubik's 3x3x3 Cube One-handed, Rubik's 4x4x4 Cube, Rubik's 5x5x5 Cube now are also 'Average of 5' format.</li>

<li>Art. 9: If an event is held, then all competitors of the competition may participate in that event. Removed the minimum number of 2 competitors per event.</li>
<li>Art. 9i: All competitors must compete in each round during the same time frame. This is added because in the past some competitors had to compete at another moment because of personal circumstances, which did not give the same conditions for all competitors. In similar cases in the future, it may be up to the competition organiser to organise a round in a suitable time frame for all competitors.</li>
<li>Art. 10: New article, moved from the procedure part. Some slight textual changes are added for clarification. Some new pictures.</li>
<li>Art. 10e/f: New description on misaligned slices, hopefully this will be clearer to all readers. In general you could say: "if one or more parallel slices are misaligned, then it is a 2 second penalty.".</li>
<li>Art. A: No explicit mention anymore of the judge having to check the scramble. This is both impractical and double work. Of course the judge should do a quick visual check whether the puzzle is scrambled at all.</li>
<li>Art. C: Textual change: of course the puzzle may touch the surface before and after inspection phase.</li>
<li>Art. C: Addition about moving after the puzzle has fallen.</li>
<li>Art. D: Explicit mention of sitting on surface or sitting in a chair.</li>
<li>Art. E: Extra stickers are allowed for Fewest Moves.</li>
<li>Art. G: New article: Rubik's 3x3x3 Cube No inspection.</li>
<li>Art. H: New article: Rubik's Magic (and similar puzzles).</li>
</ul>
Changes that were not accepted:<br>
<ul>
<li>Article 10: No penalties anymore, either solved or not solved. This may be a change for the 2007 version.</li>
<li>Article A: Minimum distance of 5 centimeter from puzzle to hands when starting the solve. In future we may start drawing a puzzle area on Stackmats.</li>
</ul>
<br>
September 23, 2005: Events without preinspection will be ranked in a separate category. Pyraminx also Average of 5.<br>
<br>
September 15, 2005: Update of the scramble program. For 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 we now use multislice moves, which makes scrambling easier.<br>
<br>
September 5, 2005: 2005 version with the following changes:<br>
<ul>
<li>Overall: Changed text to UK English and sizes to international scales.</li>

<li>Art. 5: In case of a non functional puzzle defect, there may not be an ambiguous puzzle state (example: all cube center pieces fallen off).</li>
<li>Art. 5: Puzzle defects must always be declared before timer is stopped.</li>
<li>Art. 5: Added text for puzzle defects during blindfolded events.</li>
<li>Art. 6: Winners are preferably prepared to talk to media.</li>
<li>Art. 7: Remark about the temperature in the competition area.</li>
<li>Art. 7: Competition area smoke-free. Preferably have reasonable noise level.</li>
<li>Art. 7: No objects under the timer to improve picking up the puzzle.</li>
<li>Art. 7: Changed the text about solving while sitting.</li>
<li>Art. 7: Solving With Feet: Timer on the floor, solving while sitting.</li>
<li>Art. 8: Added the article.</li>
<li>Art. 8: Slightly softened the time limit text.</li>
<li>Art. 9: Added the article.</li>
<li>Art. A: More precise description of how to start and stop the timer.</li>
<li>Art. A: Competitor may not reset the timer.</li>
<li>Art. A: Magic may elevate two tiles from flat.</li>
<li>Art. A: Events without preinspection are ranked the same as events with preinspection.</li>
<li>Art. A: Competitor may not manipulate the puzzle, after stopping the timer, until the judge has inspected the cube.</li>

<li>Art. E: Fewest moves now has a time limit of 60 minutes.</li>
<li>Art. F: Clock in standing position.</li>
</ul>
Changes that were not accepted:<br>
<ul>
<li>Different penalties for different puzzles.</li>
<li>No covering of the puzzles anymore after preinspection.</li>
<li>No change of metric for fewest moves.</li>
<li>No change in 'mean of 3'. Some people wanted a change to prevent the DNF's that we saw in recent competitions. WCA board thinks we should stay strict. We expect competitors to take fewer risks if we stay strict. And 'average of 5' for the bigger puzzles is very hard to fit in the time schedule.</li>
</ul>
<br>
November 7, 2004: Second version with some small corrections and references to the scramble programs.<br>
<br>
